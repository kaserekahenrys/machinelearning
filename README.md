## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict how they did the exercise. This is the "class" variable in the training set. You can use any of the other variables to predict with.

## Background

Using devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect a large amount of personal activity data at a relatively low price. These types of devices are part of the quantified self-movement - a group of enthusiasts who regularly take action on themselves to improve their health, to find role models in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing people do on a regular basis is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how much they do. In this project, your goal will be to use data from the accelerometers on the waistband, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants.
